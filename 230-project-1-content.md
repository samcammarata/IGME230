# Game Proposal for Meditative Beach

## I. The Concept
*Meditative Beach* is a trance game designed for the busy person who wants a way to give their mind some rest but doesn't find
meditating helpful or productive. After breathing deep, stroll down an endless beach, getting lost in the pastel atmosphere 
around you.

## II. Genre
*Meditative Beach* falls into the category of trance games or trance experiences, not played for the conclusion but rather for the
process.

Other games falling into this genre inclue [Psychra](https://nratcliff.itch.io/psychra) and [SoundSelf](http://soundselfgame.com/).

## III. Platform
*Meditative Beach* is a game made for desktop computers. 

## IV. Story
While you play, you embody a young woman, strolling down the beach and picking up beach glass casually as you walk. 

The idea behind the game and the very basic story behind it is that you, the player, suspend your everyday stresses, putting
your attention on an experiences that allows you to rest and find your calm. 

## V. Gameplay
### a. Mechanics
As the character walks around, there is intentionally few choices. Aside from the water and the dune boundaries, they can walk anywhere.
They can also choose to pick up pieces of beach glass. Aside from that, no in-game choices are presented.

### b. Control
The player will be able to control their character via the four arrow keys or WASD keys. Their visual range will follow the direction
of their movement.

### c. Onboarding
Players will be onboarded through a screen that gets them into a deep breathing and relaxed state, then through a brief screen that displays controls and does not fade out until they use them.

### d. Player Learning
Since controls are so simple, player learning will be during the first few moments of the game, most likely. That said, if learning continues throughout the game later on, there is no negative repercussions to this. Players cannot die, they simply stop walking, and there is no intentionally negative stimuli, only the presence or absence of positive stimuli.
